##Arimaa Game Engine
This project aims at developing a computer bot to play [Arimaa][1] board game. Arimaa pose some serious challenges for computation due to its undetermined initial state space in range of `10^15` and  huge branching factor.

We aim to explore artificial intelligence techniques like monte-carlo-tree-searching  and come up with interesting heuristics for evaluation function. We are studying the pattern to achieve maximum performance by parallelizing the search.
